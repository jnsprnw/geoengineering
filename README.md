## Global Adaptation Index (GAIN)
The [Notre Dame-Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN)](https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/country-index/) Country Index is a free opensource index that shows a country’s current vulnerability to climate disruptions. It also assesses a country’s readiness to leverage private and public sector investment for adaptive actions.

## Transnational Climate Impacts Index (TCI)
Climate change mitigation is widely regarded as a global problem, but climate change impacts and adaptation are typically described as regional or local issues. This reflects the location-specific nature of physical impacts, but it fails to recognize the many interconnections among countries and regions, particularly in an increasingly globalized economy.
[This paper](https://www.sei.org/publications/transnational-climate-impacts-index/) introduces a new framework for examining climate change impacts and adaptation needs from an international perspective. Based on this framework, the authors develop indicators of country-level exposure to what they call the transnational impacts of climate change: those that occur in one place as a consequence of climate impacts somewhere else. The indicators make it possible to quantify each country’s exposure across multiple dimensions. The authors also construct a composite index: the Transnational Climate Impacts Index.
